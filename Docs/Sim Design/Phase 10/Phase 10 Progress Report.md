# Phase 10 Progress Report

## Phase 10A - Audit & Cleanup (COMPLETED)
**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Lines removed from SimulationEngine**: 0 (Phase 10A was preparation/cleanup)  
**Lines removed from duplicate files**: 1,396 lines  
**Systems created/modified**: 
- Created: FarmSystem.ts (521 lines - consolidated CropSystem + WaterSystem)
- Modified: HelperSystem.ts (932 lines - integrated GnomeHousing)
- Renamed: MiningSystem.ts → MineSystem.ts (337 lines)
- Created: systemRegistry.ts (151 lines)
- Deleted: SimulationOrchestrator.ts (631 lines - failed refactor)

**Bugs fixed**: 
- Eliminated duplicate SimulationOrchestrator.ts implementation
- Fixed inconsistent system naming (MiningSystem → MineSystem)
- Resolved circular dependencies between crop and water systems

**Current SimulationEngine line count**: 610 lines (unchanged - orchestration layer only)

**Issues encountered**: 
- Type system conflicts when consolidating systems (resolved with proper typing)
- Import path updates needed after file consolidation

**Next phase ready**: ✅ Yes - Clean foundation established for Phase 10B extraction

## Next: Phase 10B - Core System Extraction
**Target**: Extract FarmSystem, TowerSystem, TownSystem from SimulationEngine.ts  
**Expected lines removed**: ~1,700 lines  
**Goal**: Move implementation details to dedicated systems while maintaining orchestration layer
