# Phase 10A Baseline Metrics

## Audit Completion Summary
**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Phase**: 10A - Audit & Cleanup  
**Objective**: Consolidate duplicate systems and establish baseline metrics for refactor

## File Sizes After Phase 10A

### Core Files
- **SimulationEngine.ts**: 610 lines (unchanged - orchestration layer)
- **SimulationOrchestrator.ts**: DELETED (631 lines - confirmed copy)

### Consolidated Systems (New)
- **FarmSystem.ts**: 521 lines (consolidated CropSystem + WaterSystem)
- **HelperSystem.ts**: 932 lines (consolidated GnomeHousing into HelperSystem)
- **systemRegistry.ts**: 151 lines (new system registry)

### Renamed Systems
- **MineSystem.ts**: 337 lines (renamed from MiningSystem.ts)

### Remaining Individual Systems
- **AdventureSystem.ts**: 296 lines (will consolidate CombatSystem + RouteEnemyRollSystem in Phase 10B)
- **CombatSystem.ts**: 710 lines (to be merged into AdventureSystem)
- **RouteEnemyRollSystem.ts**: 414 lines (to be merged into AdventureSystem)
- **CraftingSystem.ts**: 359 lines (kept separate from ForgeSystem - different concerns)
- **ForgeSystem.ts**: 288 lines (decision logic vs CraftingSystem process mechanics)
- **SeedSystem.ts**: 517 lines (kept separate from TowerSystem - different concerns)
- **TowerSystem.ts**: 308 lines (structure/upgrades vs SeedSystem mechanics)
- **TownSystem.ts**: 339 lines
- **OfflineProgressionSystem.ts**: 587 lines
- **PrerequisiteSystem.ts**: 211 lines

### Total Lines After Consolidation
- **Systems Total**: 5,970 lines (all system files)
- **Systems Active**: 4,846 lines (excluding files to be merged)

## Deleted/Merged Files

### Deleted (Failed Refactor)
- **SimulationOrchestrator.ts**: 631 lines (was a copy of SimulationEngine)

### Consolidated Into Other Systems
- **CropSystem.ts**: 157 lines â†’ merged into **FarmSystem.ts**
- **WaterSystem.ts**: 379 lines â†’ merged into **FarmSystem.ts**
- **GnomeHousing.ts**: 229 lines â†’ merged into **HelperSystem.ts**

### Renamed for Consistency
- **MiningSystem.ts** â†’ **MineSystem.ts** (class name updated to MineSystem)

## System Organization After Phase 10A

### Core Game Systems (7)
1. **FarmSystem** - Crop growth and water management
2. **TowerSystem** - Tower upgrades and structure management  
3. **TownSystem** - Town building and vendor interactions
4. **AdventureSystem** - Adventure routes and exploration (will include combat)
5. **MineSystem** - Mining operations and resource extraction
6. **ForgeSystem** - Forge management and crafting decisions
7. **HelperSystem** - Helper automation and gnome housing

### Support Systems (4)
1. **OfflineProgressionSystem** - Offline progression calculations
2. **PrerequisiteSystem** - Prerequisite validation and dependencies
3. **SeedSystem** - Seed catching mechanics and wind management
4. **CraftingSystem** - Crafting process mechanics and furnace heat

### Pending Consolidation (Phase 10B)
- **CombatSystem** + **RouteEnemyRollSystem** â†’ **AdventureSystem** (~1,124 lines to merge)

## Lines Removed/Consolidated
- **Deleted files**: 631 lines (SimulationOrchestrator.ts)
- **Consolidated files**: 765 lines (CropSystem + WaterSystem + GnomeHousing)
- **Total cleanup**: 1,396 lines removed from duplicate/redundant files

## Architecture Improvements
1. **Eliminated duplication**: No more failed refactor attempts
2. **Logical grouping**: Related functionality consolidated (crops+water, helpers+housing)
3. **Consistent naming**: MiningSystem â†’ MineSystem
4. **System registry**: Central registry for all systems with metadata
5. **Clear separation**: Kept systems with genuinely different concerns separate

## Ready for Phase 10B
- âœ… Clean starting point established
- âœ… System consolidation completed for farm and helper domains
- âœ… Baseline metrics documented
- âœ… System registry created for orchestration
- ðŸ”„ Next: Extract core systems from SimulationEngine.ts (target: ~1,700 lines)

## Issues Resolved
- Removed 631-line failed refactor attempt (SimulationOrchestrator.ts)
- Consolidated water and crop management into unified FarmSystem
- Integrated gnome housing into HelperSystem for complete helper management
- Established consistent naming convention for all systems
- Created typed system registry for clean orchestration

## Phase 10B Preview
The next phase will extract farm, tower, and town systems from SimulationEngine.ts, targeting removal of approximately 1,700 lines while maintaining clean integration points between systems.
