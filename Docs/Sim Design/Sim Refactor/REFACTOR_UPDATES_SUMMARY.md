# Refactor Updates Summary - Addressing GPT5Pro Feedback

## Overview
This document summarizes the specific updates made to the Phase 7A-7G refactor documents in response to GPT5Pro's review feedback.

## Feedback Point 1: Single Source of Truth for Material Caps
**Issue**: Helper systems (forager, refiner) should use the same storage-limit helper used in 7A for consistency.

**Resolution - Updated in 7A and 7D**:
- Changed `getStorageLimit()` from private method to exported function in 7A
- Modified signature to `export function getStorageLimit(gameState: GameState, material: string)`
- Updated 7D forager helper to import and use `getStorageLimit(gameState, 'wood')` instead of hardcoded 1000
- Added import statement: `import { getStorageLimit } from '../SimulationEngine'`

## Feedback Point 2: Helper Secondary Role
**Issue**: Secondary role implementation was just a comment, needs full implementation.

**Resolution - Updated in 7D**:
- Replaced comment with full switch statement for secondary roles
- All 9 helper roles now have secondary role implementation at 75% efficiency
- Each case properly calls the helper processing function with `secondaryEfficiency`
- Includes proper gameDataStore parameter passing where needed

## Feedback Point 3: Water System Units Clarification
**Issue**: Need to clarify that water consumed is in units, not plot count.

**Resolution - Updated in 7C**:
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comment to `distributeWater()` method
- Clarified water units vs waterLevel percentages:
  - `waterLevel`: 0.0 to 1.0 (percentage of water in plot)
  - `waterAmount`: Actual water resource units from resources.water.current
  - `waterUsed`: Water units consumed, subtracted from resources.water.current
  - Each plot can hold 1.0 water units when full
- Documented return value explicitly states "water units consumed (not plot count)"

## Feedback Point 4: Combat Wave Counts Documentation
**Issue**: Document the source of wave counts and suggest they should come from CSV.

**Resolution - Updated in 7E**:
- Added comprehensive JSDoc to `getWaveCount()` method
- Documented source: "Time Hero - Unified Game Design document Section 6.2"
- Added note that values are hardcoded for clarity
- Suggested CSV implementation: "should come from CSV data (waves_short, waves_medium, waves_long columns)"
- Added test suggestion to verify route variants produce expected wave counts

## Feedback Point 5: Consistent Energy Accounting on Harvest
**Issue**: Success criteria say "energy increases on harvest" but needs explicit logging.

**Resolution - Updated in 7D**:
- Added explicit event logging in `processHarvesterHelper()`
- When energy is added, now pushes event to gameState.events:
  ```typescript
  gameState.events.push({
    type: 'harvest',
    description: `Harvested ${cropData.name}: +${energy} energy`,
    timestamp: gameState.time.totalMinutes
  })
  ```
- This ensures energy gains are visible in ActionLog widget

## Feedback Point 6: Determinism in Simulation
**Issue**: Need seeding for reproducible tests where randomness is used.

**Resolution - Updated in 7G**:
- Added new section "Determinism and Seeding for Reproducible Tests"
- Provided `RandomNumberGenerator` class implementation using linear congruential generator
- Documented all places where randomness occurs:
  - Combat damage rolls (armor effects)
  - Material drop selection in mining
  - Loot generation
  - Helper bonus seeds
  - Master Craft double output
  - Boss quirk activations
- Added example of test setup with fixed seed for deterministic results
- Modified SimulationEngine constructor to accept optional seed parameter

## Assessment Summary

All six feedback points from GPT5Pro have been addressed with specific, actionable changes to the refactor documents:

1. ✅ **Material caps** - Now using single shared function
2. ✅ **Helper secondary role** - Full implementation added
3. ✅ **Water units** - Clear documentation added
4. ✅ **Combat wave counts** - Source documented and CSV suggestion added
5. ✅ **Energy accounting** - Explicit logging added
6. ✅ **Determinism** - Seeding system documented

The refactor documents are now more complete and address the implementation details that were missing or unclear in the original split.
