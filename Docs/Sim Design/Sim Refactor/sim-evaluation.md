# Time Hero Simulation - Design vs Implementation Evaluation

## Executive Summary
The simulation system has a strong foundation with Phase 5 (Parameter Configuration) and Phase 6 (Engine & Live Monitor) frameworks in place. However, many critical game systems are only partially implemented or stubbed out, creating significant gaps between the game design and what can actually be simulated.

## System-by-System Evaluation

### ✅ Working/Mostly Complete Systems

#### 1. **Parameter Configuration (Phase 5)**
- ✅ All 9 parameter screens implemented
- ✅ Parameter override system functional
- ✅ Map serialization for complex data structures
- ✅ Integration with simulation engine
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Parameters can be configured and passed to simulation

#### 2. **Basic Simulation Framework**
- ✅ GameState structure defined
- ✅ Web Worker architecture implemented  
- ✅ Tick-based simulation loop
- ✅ Bridge communication between worker and main thread
- **Status**: FUNCTIONAL - Core engine runs and processes ticks

#### 3. **Live Monitor UI (Phase 6)**
- ✅ All 13 widgets implemented
- ✅ Real-time updates from worker
- ✅ Control bar with speed/pause/stop
- ✅ Resource tracking and display
- **Status**: COMPLETE - Can visualize simulation progress

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented Systems

#### 4. **Farm System**
- ✅ CSV data exists with all cleanup actions and plots_added values
- ✅ Basic planting/harvesting/watering actions defined
- ⚠️ Crop growth simulation incomplete
- ⚠️ Water system mechanics stubbed
- ❌ Land cleanup execution not connected to CSV data properly
- **Status**: 40% COMPLETE - Basic farming works but expansion doesn't

#### 5. **Decision Making Engine**
- ✅ Framework for getAllPossibleActions()
- ✅ Basic scoring system implemented
- ⚠️ Many action types return placeholder data
- ⚠️ Prerequisite checking incomplete
- ❌ CSV data not properly parsed for prerequisites
- **Status**: 30% COMPLETE - Makes decisions but with limited intelligence

#### 6. **Tower/Seed System**
- ✅ Basic catch_seeds action defined
- ⚠️ Auto-catcher simulation stubbed
- ❌ Seed distribution by reach level not implemented
- ❌ Wind level mechanics missing
- **Status**: 20% COMPLETE - Framework exists but mechanics missing

### ❌ Missing/Stubbed Systems

#### 7. **Combat & Adventure System**
- ❌ No actual combat simulation (placeholder only)
- ❌ Wave/enemy generation not implemented
- ❌ Weapon advantage system stubbed
- ❌ Boss mechanics completely missing
- ❌ Armor effects not simulated
- **Status**: 5% COMPLETE - Only basic route selection

#### 8. **Crafting/Forge System**
- ⚠️ Basic craft action defined
- ❌ Heat management not implemented
- ❌ Material refinement missing
- ❌ Tool progression not tracked properly
- ❌ Success rates and timing not simulated
- **Status**: 10% COMPLETE - Can't actually craft items

#### 9. **Mining System**
- ⚠️ Basic mine action defined
- ❌ Depth progression not simulated
- ❌ Energy drain mechanics missing
- ❌ Material drops not implemented
- ❌ Pickaxe efficiency not calculated
- **Status**: 10% COMPLETE - Can't actually mine

#### 10. **Helper/Gnome System**
- ✅ Basic helper state structure
- ⚠️ Role assignment framework exists
- ❌ Helper efficiency not applied
- ❌ Training system not implemented
- ❌ Housing requirements not enforced
- ❌ Dual-role mechanics missing
- **Status**: 15% COMPLETE - Helpers exist but don't help

#### 11. **Town/Purchasing System**
- ✅ Basic purchase action defined
- ⚠️ Some vendor categorization
- ❌ Blueprint system not connected
- ❌ Skill training not implemented
- ❌ Material trading missing
- **Status**: 20% COMPLETE - Can buy some things

## Critical Gaps Analysis

### 1. **CSV Data Integration Gap**
The CSV files contain comprehensive game data but the simulation engine doesn't properly parse and use it:
- Material costs parsed incorrectly (regex issues)
- Prerequisites not validated against actual game state
- Effects and modifiers ignored
- Durations and timing not extracted properly

### 2. **Game State Management Gap**
The GameState structure exists but isn't properly updated:
- Plots don't increase when cleanups complete
- Tools/weapons don't get added to inventory
- Helpers don't affect automation
- Resources don't get consumed/generated correctly

### 3. **Action Execution Gap**
Actions are generated but not properly executed:
- Many executeAction() cases are empty
- State changes are incomplete
- Side effects not implemented
- Rewards/costs not applied

### 4. **Progression Tracking Gap**
Game progression isn't properly tracked:
- Phase transitions not detected
- Unlocks not recorded
- Prerequisites not checked properly
- Bottlenecks not identified

## Can the Simulation Answer Key Questions?

### ❌ **Can it simulate seed catching?**
No - Wind levels and seed distribution mechanics are missing

### ⚠️ **Can it simulate crop farming?**
Partially - Basic planting/harvesting works but water mechanics incomplete

### ❌ **Can it simulate farm cleanup and gaining plots?**
No - Despite CSV data existing, the execution doesn't increase plot count

### ❌ **Can it track crafted tools and weapons?**
No - Crafting doesn't actually add items to inventory

### ❌ **Can it simulate combat waves and bosses?**
No - Combat is completely stubbed with placeholder calculations

### ⚠️ **Can it simulate town purchases?**
Partially - Some purchases work but effects aren't applied

### ❌ **Can it simulate forge crafting?**
No - Heat mechanics and material consumption missing

### ❌ **Can it simulate mining?**
No - Depth progression and material gathering not implemented

### ❌ **Can it simulate helpers?**
No - Helpers exist in state but don't provide any automation

## Overall Assessment

**Current Capability**: The simulation can run basic farming loops with simple decision making, but cannot accurately simulate the full Time Hero experience. Most complex systems are stubbed or missing.

**Completion Status**: Approximately **25% functional** for actual game simulation

**Biggest Blockers**:
1. CSV data parsing and integration
2. Action execution implementation
3. Combat system completely missing
4. Helper automation not functioning
5. Resource management incomplete

The framework is solid, but the actual game mechanics implementation needs significant work to accurately simulate Time Hero gameplay.
