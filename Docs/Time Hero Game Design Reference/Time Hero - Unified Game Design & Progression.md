# **Time Hero – Unified Game Design & Progression**

## **1\) Vision & Pillars**

* One-hand friendly controls (d-pad/A/B; short crank bursts only).  
* Autonomy-first hero behavior; you set direction via upgrades.  
* Purposeful idling capped by storage. Clear, readable time & cost.  
* **Real-time progression**: All timers (growth, crafting, adventures) use real-world minutes/hours. There is no separate "game time" \- when something takes 30 minutes, that's 30 real minutes.

## **2\) Core Loop**

Seeds → Farm → Food → Energy → Adventures/Mine/Forge → Gold & Materials → Town Upgrades → Better Seeds/Production → repeat.

### **2.1) Screen quick reference**

| Screen | What it does | Why you visit | Key progression levers |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Home / Farm** | Grow and harvest crops; pump water; perform land cleanups. Generates most **energy**. | To gain energy and fuel for all other activities. | Agronomist upgrades; Land Deeds; Carry skill; Tools from Blacksmith. |
| **Tower** | Extend arm to catch seeds at different wind levels; unlock higher bands; set up Auto-Catcher. | To gain seeds to access better crops and broaden the seed pool. | Wind levels (replacing floors), Nets, Auto-Catchers from Carpenter. |
| **Town** | Vendor hub for blueprints, deeds, and skills. | To buy progression-critical unlocks. | Blacksmith (tools/forge), Agronomist (farm systems), Land Steward (deeds), Skills Trainer (skills). |
| **Adventure** | Sign Post to choose routes with risk assessment; auto-combat with weapon switching; earn boss materials, gold, and armor pieces. Hero HP and Defense determine survivability | To gain gold, finish quests and free helpers. | Route tiers unlocked by finishing previous routes. (Soft gated by energy & items) |
| **Forge** | Craft tools and upgrades via heat-band timing; refine raw materials; increase throughput. | To unlock/upgrade tools and forge tiers. Refine raw materials. | Bellows, Furnace, Anvils, Recipes from Blacksmith. |
| **Mine** | Convert energy to depth over time; sharpen tools for buffs; find materials/helpers. | To acquire raw materials. | Pickaxe tiers gate depth access; energy drain limits deep runs. |

### **2.2) Phases by Farm Expansion**

Phases are defined by the farm's **land deeds** (purchased in Town) and the cleanups you complete afterward. **Progression is based entirely on prerequisites and achievements, not real-world time.**

| Phase | Farm Level | Land Size | Deed (Town) | Prerequisites | Post-Deed Cleanups |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Tutorial | Starter Plot | 3→8 plots | – (tutorial area) | – | Clear weeds & till |
| Early Game | Small Hold | 8→20 plots | – (no deed) | Complete Stage 1 | Rocks & till batches |
| Mid Game | Homestead | 20→40 plots | **Homestead Deed** | Complete Stage 2 (20 plots) | Boulders \+ stumps \+ till |
| Late Game | Manor Grounds | 40→65 plots | **Manor Grounds Deed** | Complete Stage 3 (40 plots) | Excavations \+ thickets \+ terraform |
| End Game | Great Estate | 65→90 plots | **Great Estate Deed** | Complete Stage 4 (65 plots) | Blasts \+ ancient roots \+ sacred clearing |
| Post Game | Legacy Estate | 90+ plots | (Future Content) | Complete Stage 5 | (Future Content) |

**Note on Post-Game**: A prestige system is planned where your hero eventually grows old and the farm falls into disrepair. Your child then inherits the land and begins anew with certain bonuses. This system will be fully designed after the core game loop is perfected.

### **2.3) Farm Manageability Expansion**

| Phase | Plots | Hero Alone | Management Strategy |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Tutorial | 3-8 | Manageable | Direct control |
| Early | 8-20 | Challenging | Upgrade Hero |
| Mid | 20-40 | Overwhelming | Get helper |
| Late | 40-65 | Impossible | Get more helpers & upgrades |
| Endgame | 65-90 | Impossible | Even more helpers & upgrades |
| Post-End | 90-120 | Impossible | Full automation kingdom |

## **3\) Home – Farm**

**What you do:** Plant → water → harvest. The farm is the primary **energy** engine and the pacing driver for the whole game.

**Key actions**

* Pump water (crank) to fill the tank.  
* Plant from seed storage; harvest into crop storage.  
* Perform on-farm **cleanups** (ticks). **New land** (deeds) is bought in Town.

### **Water System**

* **Plots drain water at a standard rate** when watered (1 water per plot)  
* **All crops require the same water** regardless of type or growth stage  
* **Optimizations come from**:  
  * More gnomes assigned to watering roles  
  * Bigger watering cans (water multiple plots at once)  
  * Higher water capacity and pump speeds

### **Energy Conversion**

* **Harvested crops instantly convert to energy** when collected  
* **No intermediate crop storage** \- energy is the universal currency  
* **Players don't track individual food types** in their energy pool

### **Inputs and Actions**

| Input | Action | Details |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **D-pad** | Navigate menus | Move through upgrade options, cleanup tasks, and farm management menus |
| **B Button** | Inventory | View current seeds, see what crops are planted, check storage levels |
| **A Button** | Action menu | Direct hero to spend resources on tasks (e.g., "Spend 150 energy to remove stump") |
| **Crank** | Pump water | Physical pump motion \- crank up and down to draw water into the well tank |

### **3.1 Unlock Order (Farm)**

Farm unlocks are grouped by **farm stage** (based on plot count). This section removes deed references; purchases happen elsewhere.

| Order | Farm Stage | Plots Range | What it does | Cleanups (on Farm) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1 | **Stage 1 – Starter Plot** | 3→8 | Teaches core loop; small, safe workspace to learn water/carry rhythm | Clear Weeds → Till |
| 2 | **Stage 2 – Small Hold** | 8→20 | Expands field; introduces rocks; raises energy/water demands modestly | Rocks → Till batches |
| 3 | **Stage 3 – Homestead** | 20→40 | Major capacity jump; unlocks tougher obstacles; sets up mid-tier crops/routes | Boulders → Stumps → Till |
| 4 | **Stage 4 – Manor Grounds** | 40→65 | Broad expansion; requires advanced tools; supports late-tier crops & longer runs | Excavations → Thickets → Terraform |
| 5 | **Stage 5 – Great Estate** | 65→90 | Endgame farmland size; enables heavy automation and late cleanups | Blasts → Ancient Roots → Sacred Clearing |

**Automatic Planting Priority:** The hero automatically plants seeds in this order:

1. Highest energy value seeds first (best available)  
2. Fills remaining plots with lower-tier seeds  
3. Maintains diversity for continuous harvests

**Seed Distribution Guidelines:**

* **Early Game (150 storage)**: Focus on 2-3 crop types  
* **Mid Game (500 storage)**: Maintain 4-5 crop types, 100 each  
* **Late Game (2,000 storage)**:  
  * 30% highest tier seeds (600)  
  * 40% mid-tier seeds (800)  
  * 30% low-tier backup seeds (600)

**Why Keep Low-Tier Seeds?**

* Fill gaps when high-tier seeds run out  
* Maintain continuous energy generation  
* Quick turnover for immediate energy needs

## **4\) Tower – Catch Seeds**

**What you do:** Use an extending arm with net to catch drifting seeds at different wind levels. The **Auto-Catcher** runs passively and draws from a **fixed seed pool** based on the wind level where you unlocked it.

**Key actions**

* Extend/retract arm to reach different wind levels  
* Position net to catch seeds as they drift by  
* Unlock higher wind levels for rarer seeds  
* Install Auto-Catchers for passive collection

### **Inputs and Actions**

| Crystal Net | Golden Net \+ **Reach 5** 🏡 | 15,000 | 8,000 | 2 Crystal | \+80% catch rate (active play) |

### **4.4 Auto-Catchers (Passive Seed Collection)**

| Upgrade | Prerequisites | Gold | Build Energy | Materials | Effect | Idle Rate |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Auto-Catcher I | Tower built | 1,000 | 500 | 10 Iron | Collects seeds from levels 0 to (highest reach \- 2\) | 1 seed/10 min |
| Auto-Catcher II | Auto-Catcher I | 5,000 | 2,500 | 5 Silver | Collects seeds from levels 0 to (highest reach \- 2\) | 1 seed/5 min |
| Auto-Catcher III | Auto-Catcher II \+ **Reach 5** 🏡 | 30,000 | 15,000 | 3 Crystal | Collects seeds from levels 0 to (highest reach \- 1\) | 1 seed/2 min |

**Auto-Catcher rule:** The auto-catcher passively collects seeds while idle. Seed pool is based on your highest unlocked reach level (minus 1-2 levels for balance). Higher tier auto-catchers collect faster and from a wider pool.

**Seed System Notes:**

* Each wind level contains all seeds of that Seed Level and below  
* Seeds appear randomly within their wind level (equal catch chance)  
* With 30 seeds/hour from Auto-Catcher III, players gain 720 seeds/day while idle  
* Combined with active catching (3-8 seeds/min with nets), seed requirements are achievable  
* Early game needs fewer seeds (8-20 plots), late game has better catchers

\*Runtime shown with base Pickaxe I. Higher tier pickaxes reduce energy drain \- see Section 11.3 for details.

**Mining Shortcuts** (Build after clearing each depth to start there next time):

| Shortcut | Prerequisites | Gold | Build Energy | Materials | Effect |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Depth 2 Entry | Reached \-1000 | 100 | 50 | 10 Stone | Start at Depth 2 |
| Depth 3 Entry | Reached \-1500 | 250 | 150 | 5 Copper | Start at Depth 3 |
| Depth 4 Entry | Reached \-2000 | 500 | 300 | 10 Iron | Start at Depth 4 |
| Depth 5 Entry | Reached \-2500 | 1,000 | 600 | 5 Silver | Start at Depth 5 |
| Depth 6 Entry | Reached \-3000 | 2,500 | 1,500 | 10 Silver | Start at Depth 6 |
| Depth 7 Entry | Reached \-3500 | 5,000 | 3,000 | 2 Crystal | Start at Depth 7 |
| Depth 8 Entry | Reached \-4000 | 10,000 | 6,000 | 5 Crystal | Start at Depth 8 |
| Depth 9 Entry | Reached \-4500 | 25,000 | 15,000 | 1 Mythril | Start at Depth 9 |
| Depth 10 Entry | Reached \-5000 | 50,000 | 30,000 | 2 Mythril | Start at Depth 10 |

**Mining Notes:**

* **Shortcuts**: Once you reach the bottom of a depth level, you can build a shortcut to start there next time  
* **Auto-Mining**: Players can always start from depth 0 and let the hero mine automatically through multiple levels until energy runs out  
* **Progressive Drain**: When mining through multiple depths, energy drain adjusts as you pass each threshold (e.g., 2/min from 0 to \-500, then 4/min from \-500 to \-1000, etc.)  
* **Material Collection**: You gain appropriate materials from each depth level as you pass through (every 30 seconds)  
* **Scaling Philosophy**: Deeper levels yield exponentially more materials per drop to compensate for exponentially higher energy costs  
* **Pickaxe Efficiency**: Higher tier pickaxes reduce energy drain \- see Section 11.3 for details  
* Energy drain is continuous while mining  
* Return to surface at any time, keeping all materials collected  
* Tool sharpening (crank mechanic) reduces energy drain by 25% for 5 minutes

### **8.3 Mining Tools – Unlocks**

**Note**: Pickaxes don't gate depth access \- you can always mine from depth 0 to 10\. Instead, they reduce energy drain to make deeper mining viable. See Section 11.3 for pickaxe efficiency details.

## **9\) Helpers (Gnomes) \- Role-Based System**

**What they do:** Gnomes are rescued from adventure bosses and join your farm to repay your kindness. Each gnome focuses on a single task at a time, automating crucial farm operations as plot counts become overwhelming.

### **9.1 Gnome Acquisition**

* **One-time rescue**: Each major boss (Dark Forest and beyond) rescues exactly one gnome on first Long route clear  
* **Total available**: 5 gnomes (Dark Forest, Mountain Pass, Crystal Caves, Frozen Tundra, Volcano Core)  
* **Subsequent runs**: Drop boss materials only, no additional gnomes

### **9.2 Gnome Housing Requirement**

**Important**: Rescued gnomes must rest before they can work. Without proper housing, a gnome will sit sadly in the corner of the Forge, unable to help. Once you build appropriate housing from the Carpenter in Town, they will have somewhere to sleep and can get to work.

### **9.3 Gnome Roles**

Each gnome must be assigned a single role. Roles can be changed at any time on the Farm screen.

| Role | Function | Base Effect | Leveled Effect | Max Level Effect |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Waterer** | Waters crops automatically | Waters 5 plots/minute | \+1 plot per level | 15 plots/minute at L10 |
| **Pump Operator** | Generates water passively | \+20 water/hour | \+5 water/hour per level | \+70 water/hour at L10 |
| **Sower** | Plants seeds automatically after harvest | Plants 3 seeds/minute | \+1 seed per level | 13 seeds/minute at L10 |
| **Harvester** | Collects and stores crops | Harvests 4 plots/minute | \+1 plot per level | 14 plots/minute at L10 |
| **Miner's Friend** | Reduces mining energy cost | \-15% energy drain | \-3% per level | \-45% energy drain at L10 |
| **Adventure Fighter** | Assists in combat | 5 neutral damage/hit | \+2 damage per level | 25 damage/hit at L10 |
| **Adventure Support** | Assists in combat | Heals 1 HP/30 secl | \+2 damage per level |  25 damage/hit at L1 |
| **Seed Catcher** | Boosts tower efficiency | \+10% catch rate | \+2% per level | \+30% catch rate at L10 |
| **Forager** | Collects wood from stumps | 5 wood/hour from cleared stumps | \+2 wood per level | 25 wood/hour at L10 |
| **Refiner** | Assists at forge | \+5% refinement speed | \+1% per level | \+15% speed at L10 |

**Scaling Notes**:

* With 5 max-level gnomes in watering roles, you can manage 75 plots/minute  
* The **Master Academy** enables dual-role gnomes (75% efficiency each role), effectively giving you 10 active roles  
* The **Sower** role provides full automation by replanting harvested plots with appropriate seeds  
* Combined with longer growth times (30-50 minutes for endgame crops), the helper system can manage 90 plots

### **9.3 Gnome Management**

* **Role Assignment**: Change roles freely on Farm screen (instant switch)  
* **Housing**: Build gnome quarters in Town to activate rescued gnomes  
* **Training**: Feed surplus crops to level up gnomes (max level 10\)  
* **Efficiency**: Higher levels increase role effectiveness

### **Gnome Progression**

| Level | XP Required | Energy Cost | Training Time |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1→2 | 100 | 50 | 30 min |
| 2→3 | 300 | 150 | 1 hour |
| 3→4 | 600 | 300 | 2 hours |
| 4→5 | 1,000 | 500 | 4 hours |
| 5→6 | 2,000 | 1,000 | 8 hours |
| 6→7 | 4,000 | 2,000 | 12 hours |
| 7→8 | 8,000 | 4,000 | 18 hours |
| 8→9 | 16,000 | 8,000 | 24 hours |
| 9→10 | 32,000 | 16,000 | 36 hours |

### **9.4 Gnome Training Academy (Late Game)**

| Building | Prerequisites | Gold | Build Energy | Materials | Effect |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Training Grounds | Gnome Lodge \+ **Manor Grounds** | 25,000 | 10,000 | 200 Wood, 10 Silver, Cave Crystal ×2 | Reduces training time by 25% |
| Master Academy | Training Grounds \+ **Great Estate** | 100,000 | 50,000 | 500 Wood, 5 Crystal, Frozen Heart ×1 | Reduces training time by 50%, enables dual-role gnomes |

*Note: The paradigm shift from manual farming to gnome management occurs around 20-25 plots when the first gnome is rescued. Gnome housing must be purchased from the Carpenter in Town (see Section 5.6.3). The Master Academy allows gnomes to perform two roles simultaneously at 75% efficiency each.*

## **10\) Offline Progression System**

## **Overview**

Time Hero continues progressing while the device is locked or the game is suspended. This respects player time and enables the idle gameplay loop on a handheld device. The game uses smart offline calculation that doesn't simulate every tick but calculates the end result efficiently.

## **Core Principles**

* **Real-Time Progression**: All timers use real-world time (growth, crafting, adventures continue offline)  
* **Resource Gating**: Water and seeds gate offline growth \- no infinite generation  
* **Storage Caps**: Energy and material caps prevent runaway accumulation  
* **Fair Distribution**: Resources are distributed evenly across all eligible targets  
* **Summary on Return**: Simple "While you were away..." modal shows what happened

## **10.1 System-Specific Offline Behavior**

### **10.1.1 Farm System**

**How it works:**

* Crops continue growing with available water  
* Auto-harvest when ready (if energy cap allows)  
* Auto-sow if seeds available and plots empty  
* Water distributes evenly across all active plots

**Limitations:**

* Water supply (plots \+ well total)  
* Seed availability (1 seed per plant/replant)  
* Energy storage cap (harvests stop when full)  
* No hero movement simulation

**Calculation Details:**

1. Convert offline time to growth ticks  
2. Calculate total water available (plot water \+ well water)  
3. Distribute water evenly across active plots  
4. Apply "wet" growth while water available, then "dry" growth  
5. Count harvests, spend seeds for replants  
6. Stop harvesting if energy cap reached  
7. Update final water levels

### **10.1.2 Tower System**

**How it works:**

* Auto-Catcher continues at configured rate  
* Collects from seed pool based on highest reach level  
* Seeds accumulate up to storage cap

**Limitations:**

* Seed storage capacity (150-2,000)  
* Catch rate (1 seed per 2-10 minutes based on tier)  
* Seed pool (highest reach minus 1-2 levels)

**Auto-Catcher Rates:**

* Tier I: 1 seed/10 minutes  
* Tier II: 1 seed/5 minutes  
* Tier III: 1 seed/2 minutes

### **10.1.3 Adventure System**

**How it works:**

* Adventures in progress continue running  
* Complete and store rewards for collection  
* Cannot start new adventures while offline

**Limitations:**

* Must be started before going offline  
* One adventure at a time  
* Rewards wait in "completed" state

### **10.1.4 Mining System**

**How it works:**

* Continues at current depth until energy depleted  
* Materials collected every 30 seconds  
* Stops when energy reaches zero or depth complete

**Limitations:**

* Energy drain rate (2^depth per minute)  
* Material storage caps  
* Cannot change depths while offline  
* Tool sharpening buff expires normally

### **10.1.5 Forge System**

**How it works:**

* Current crafting continues  
* Batch crafting processes sequentially  
* Items complete and wait for collection  
* Material refinement continues

**Limitations:**

* Queue processes in order  
* Cannot add new items to queue  
* Success rates apply normally  
* Heat gradually decreases to idle level

### **10.1.6 Helper System**

**How it works:**

* Helpers continue assigned tasks  
* Training progresses if food available  
* Efficiency based on current level  
* Role assignments maintained

**Limitations:**

* Training consumes food stocks  
* Cannot change roles while offline  
* Dual-role efficiency (75% each) applies

## **10.2 Offline Duration Rules**

### **Time Limits**

* **Maximum Credit**: 24 hours (prevents exploitation)  
* **Minimum Credit**: 60 seconds (avoids micro-interruptions)  
* **Menu Pause**: System menu pause doesn't count as offline time

## **10.3 "While You Were Away" Summary**

The modal displays:

* **Time Away**: Humanized format ("2 hours 15 minutes")  
* **Energy Gained**: Total from all harvests  
* **Seeds Collected**: Breakdown by type if multiple  
* **Adventures**: Completed routes and rewards  
* **Mining**: Depth reached and materials gathered  
* **Crafting**: Items completed  
* **Helpers**: Training progress and level-ups  
* **Water Generated**: From auto-pumps

**Interaction**: Press A button to dismiss modal and resume play

## **10.4 Balance Considerations**

### **Encouraging Active Play**

* Manual catching more efficient than auto-catcher  
* Heat band minigame improves forge success  
* Tool sharpening requires active input  
* Adventure route selection matters

### **Respecting Idle Time**

* Meaningful progress while away  
* No penalty for short sessions  
* Storage caps prevent waste anxiety  
* Clear feedback on return

### **Preventing Exploitation**

* 24-hour maximum prevents date manipulation  
* Resource caps limit accumulation  
* No offline adventure starting  
* Energy gating prevents infinite loops

## **Summary**

The offline system transforms Time Hero from a demanding active game into a respectful idle experience. Players can engage in short sessions throughout the day, knowing their farm continues working. The system maintains game balance while respecting the realities of playing on a handheld device.

Key achievement: Players feel rewarded for returning without feeling punished for leaving.

| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Pickaxe I | Base | 0% | 0% | Depth 10 | Starting pickaxe |
| Pickaxe II | Iron | \-15% | \+10% | Depth 10 | Slightly faster mining |
| Pickaxe III | Silver | \-30% | \+20% | Depth 10 | Good efficiency |
| Crystal Pick | Crystal | \-45% | \+30% | Depth 10 | Excellent efficiency |
| Abyss Seeker | Mythril | \-60% | \+50% | Depth 10 | Can sense rare materials (2x obsidian chance) |

**Pickaxe Energy Calculation**: `Actual Drain = Base Drain × (1 - Pickaxe Reduction)`

* Example: Depth 10 with Crystal Pick \= 1024 × 0.55 \= 563 energy/min  
* Example: Depth 10 with Abyss Seeker \= 1024 × 0.40 \= 410 energy/min

**Material Bonus**: Increases all material drops by the percentage shown.

#### **Watering Tools Evolution**

| Tool | Plots Watered | Craft Requirements | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Hero Hands | 1 | – | Starting tool |
| Watering Can II | 2 | 5 Copper \+ 3 Wood | First upgrade |
| Sprinkler Can | 4 | 3 Silver \+ Pine Resin ×1 | Mid-game essential |
| Rain Bringer | 8 | 1 Crystal \+ Frozen Heart ×1 | Endgame automation |

#### **Tool Progression Philosophy**

* **Base Tools**: Enable the mechanic (clear obstacles, mine, water)  
* **Plus Tools (+)**: Improve efficiency by 2x, require boss materials  
* **Master Tools**: Transform the mechanic (3-4x efficiency, special abilities), require rare boss materials

**Tool Naming Convention**:

* Base and Plus tools use descriptive names (Hammer, Hammer+)  
* Master tools get epic names that hint at their power (Stone Breaker, World Splitter, Earth Mover)

**Tool Gating**:

* Base tools gate access to game mechanics  
* Plus tools gate mid-game efficiency  
* Master tools are prestige items for endgame optimization
