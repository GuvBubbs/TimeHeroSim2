# Time Hero - Starting Conditions Reference
## Phase 9A Update

### Starting Resources
- **Energy**: 0 (gain through harvesting crops)
- **Gold**: 75 (enough to buy Sword I & Tower Reach 1 blueprints)
- **Water**: 0 (pump to fill tank)
- **Seeds**: 2 total
  - 1 Carrot seed
  - 1 Radish seed
- **Plots**: 3 (leaves 1 empty plot, encouraging seed collection)

### Tower Access
- **Tower Reach 1**: FREE (0 gold)
  - Unlocks Ground Level (Seed Level 0)
  - Provides access to Carrot and Radish seeds
- **Tower Reach 2**: 100 gold
  - Unlocks Breeze band (Seed Level 1)
  - Provides access to Potato, Cabbage, Turnip seeds

### Early Game Progression
1. Player starts with 2 seeds for 3 plots
2. Plants initial seeds, has 1 empty plot
3. Pumps water (free action)
4. Harvests crops for energy
5. Can immediately catch more seeds at tower (Reach 1 is free)
6. Uses 50 starting gold to buy Sword I blueprint
7. Saves up 100 gold for Tower Reach 2 to access better seeds

### Design Philosophy
- Players always have a viable action (no deadlock states)
- Starting with 2 seeds for 3 plots creates immediate need for tower
- Free Tower Reach 1 ensures seed collection is always possible
- 50 gold enables first combat upgrade (Sword I)
- 0 starting energy forces immediate farming engagement
