# Development Archive

This directory contains development artifacts that were moved from the project root during cleanup.

## Structure

- **debug-tools/**: HTML and JavaScript files used for debugging specific issues during development
- **legacy-tests/**: JavaScript test files from earlier development phases (before proper TypeScript/Vitest setup)
- **demos-and-snippets/**: Demo files and code snippets used during development

## Purpose

These files are preserved for historical reference and potential future use, but are not part of the main application codebase. The actual test suite is located in the `/tests` directory and uses TypeScript with Vitest.

## Cleanup Note

This archive was created on September 2, 2025 during a project cleanup. Files can be safely deleted if no longer needed for reference.
