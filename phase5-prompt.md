## üöÄ Phase 5: Enhanced Highlight Mode & Interactive Connections - TimeHero Sim Upgrade Tree

**Project**: TimeHero Sim  
**Component**: Upgrade Tree System  
**Phase**: 5 - Enhanced Highlight Mode & Interactive Connections  
**Previous Phases**: ‚úÖ Phase 1 (Basic Structure), ‚úÖ Phase 2 (Layout Algorithm), ‚úÖ Phase 2.5 (Perfect Node Centering), ‚úÖ Phase 3 (Enhanced Visual Design), ‚úÖ Phase 4 (Connection Layer)

### üéØ Phase 5 Objectives

Transform the basic highlight system into a sophisticated, interactive dependency visualization that provides comprehensive family tree traversal, smooth animations, and rich interactive feedback for complex dependency relationships.

### üìã Phase 5 Tasks

**1. Enhanced Family Tree Highlighting**
- **Complete Dependency Traversal**: Implement recursive algorithms to find all prerequisites and dependents
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Distinguish between direct dependencies (1-hop) and indirect dependencies (2+ hops)
- **Cross-Swimlane Discovery**: Reveal hidden dependency chains that span multiple swimlanes
- **Bidirectional Highlighting**: Show both "what depends on this" and "what this depends on"

**2. Interactive Connection System**
- **Connection Click Handlers**: Allow users to click on connection lines to highlight specific dependency paths
- **Connection Tooltips**: Rich hover information showing dependency details and requirements
- **Smart Connection Highlighting**: Highlight connection paths when hovering over related nodes
- **Connection Context**: Show additional metadata about dependency relationships

**3. Advanced Visual Feedback**
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for highlight state changes with staggered timing
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Gradually reveal connection complexity to avoid overwhelming users
- **Enhanced Visual States**: Multiple highlight levels (primary, secondary, tertiary dependencies)
- **Performance Optimizations**: Efficient rendering for complex dependency trees with 50+ connected nodes

**4. Intelligent Interaction Patterns**
- **Smart Selection Logic**: Click same node to toggle off, click related nodes to expand selection
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate between connected nodes
- **Multi-Selection**: Hold Ctrl/Cmd to highlight multiple dependency trees simultaneously
- **Context Awareness**: Different behaviors based on connection type and swimlane relationships

### üèóÔ∏è Current State

**‚úÖ Solid Foundation:**
- Perfect connection rendering with 460+ nodes positioned correctly
- SVG overlay with intelligent path routing (within vs cross-swimlane)
- Basic highlight mode with node click handling
- Swimlane-specific arrow markers with 6x5px optimization
- Right-edge to left-edge connection flow

**üìÅ Key Files to Enhance:**
- `src/stores/upgradeTree.ts` - Enhanced highlight algorithms and state management
- `src/components/UpgradeTree/ConnectionLayer.vue` - Interactive connection handling
- `src/components/UpgradeTree/TreeNode.vue` - Enhanced visual states and animations
- `src/views/UpgradeTreeView.vue` - Keyboard navigation and multi-selection logic

**üîó Available Data:**
- Complete `connections` array with from/to relationships
- Node positioning with exact pixel coordinates
- Highlight state management with `highlightedNodes` Set
- Store methods: `enterHighlightMode()`, `exitHighlightMode()`, `isNodeHighlighted()`

### üé® Technical Requirements

**Family Tree Traversal Algorithm:**
```typescript
interface DependencyTree {
  selected: string[]                    // Primary selected nodes
  directPrerequisites: string[]        // 1-hop dependencies (what this needs)
  indirectPrerequisites: string[]      // 2+ hop dependencies
  directDependents: string[]           // 1-hop dependents (what needs this)
  indirectDependents: string[]         // 2+ hop dependents
  connectionPaths: ConnectionPath[]    // Specific dependency paths
}

interface ConnectionPath {
  from: string
  to: string
  depth: number                        // Hop count from selected node
  type: 'prerequisite' | 'dependent'
  swimlaneSpan: string[]              // Swimlanes this path crosses
}
```

**Enhanced Visual States:**
```css
/* Primary selection - bright gold */
.tree-node.selected { border-color: #fbbf24; }

/* Direct dependencies - medium highlight */
.tree-node.direct-dependency { border-color: #f59e0b; opacity: 1; }

/* Indirect dependencies - subtle highlight */
.tree-node.indirect-dependency { border-color: #d97706; opacity: 0.8; }

/* Connection highlighting */
.connection-line.primary { stroke: #fbbf24; stroke-width: 3; }
.connection-line.secondary { stroke: #f59e0b; stroke-width: 2; }
.connection-line.tertiary { stroke: #d97706; stroke-width: 1.5; }
```

**Animation System:**
```css
/* Staggered highlight animations */
.tree-node { transition: all 0.3s ease; }
.tree-node.highlight-enter { animation: highlightIn 0.5s ease; }
.connection-line { transition: all 0.4s ease; }

@keyframes highlightIn {
  0% { opacity: 0; transform: scale(0.95); }
  50% { opacity: 0.7; transform: scale(1.02); }
  100% { opacity: 1; transform: scale(1); }
}
```
